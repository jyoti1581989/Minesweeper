# Minesweeper
Minesweeper is single-player logic-based computer game played on rectangular board whose object is to locate a predetermined number of randomly-placed "mines" by clicking on "safe" squares while avoiding the squares with mines.

The simple Rules for Minesweeper: 

To win a round of Minesweeper, you must identify every square on the board that have a mine under it. Once you've done so, the game will be over. If you accidentally click a square that has a mine beneath it, the game will be over. You'll have the option of starting a new game.
